The song mostly came together in the very first session as the original has some incredible material to work with. I just tried to bring the song into my own world by adding some new sounds and letting the idea flow freely. Really happy with how it turned out. I hope you enjoy, and thank you for listening.","date":"2023-01-26","top_minter":"https://www.sound.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2i9ybouka0ieh.cloudfront.net%2Fuser-uploads%2F9caecb9c-2f8c-49f4-97c0-d23ccbb06e72%2FAVATAR_IMAGE%2F4428112-newImage.png&w=3840&q=75","contract":"0x1260bb441b4566c51Feb212C3e28c2f7975e715E","url":"https://www.sound.xyz/rosalie/half-life-green-ring-remix?referral=0x54c3283577c40eaa637d35106b7c5c6b387c5ab0&referral_source=link"},{"artist":"dreamsuite","avatar":"https://www.sound.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2i9ybouka0ieh.cloudfront.net%2Fuser-uploads%2Fb0e52031-9e91-4db8-8166-e151ce5824d6%2FAVATAR_IMAGE%2F8191853-newImage.png&w=3840&q=75","title":"be with u","cover":"https://www.sound.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2i9ybouka0ieh.cloudfront.net%2Fartist-uploads%2Fdeb6c75f-4166-4a74-8fe5-c6e47aebe68e%2FRELEASE_COVER_IMAGE%2F8815531-newImage.png&w=640&q=75","order":4,"description":"\"be with u\" is an emotional indie dance/future house fusion and is my first release of 2024.
